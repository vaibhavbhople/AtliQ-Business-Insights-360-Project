# AtliQ Business Insight 360 – Power BI Dashboard for AtliQ Hardware
## Project Overview
The AtliQ Business Insight 360 project leverages Power BI to provide AtliQ Hardware, a global leader in computer and computer accessory sales, with comprehensive insights into their performance across various functions such as Finance, Sales, Supply Chain, Executive, and Marketing. Despite rapid expansion worldwide, AtliQ Hardware has faced challenges, particularly with the recent opening of a store in Latin America. This project aims to tackle those challenges through effective data visualization and analytics.

## Key Challenges
AtliQ Hardware’s global expansion has been marred by several business challenges:

1. New Store Openings: Issues with store performance, especially in new markets like Latin America.
2. Operational Expenses and Profitability: Increasing discounts and high operational expenses are eroding profit margins.
3. Regional Underperformance: Certain regions, such as the USA, are underperforming across the board.
   
## Goals of the Project
The primary objectives for implementing this Power BI dashboard were:

1. Improve Decision Making: Empower leadership with real-time data to make informed decisions.
2. Boost Profitability: Identify areas to cut costs and optimize sales and operations.
3. Drive Market Share Growth: Provide insights on improving sales performance, especially in underperforming regions.
   
## Actions Taken
We began by integrating data from AtliQ Hardware’s databases and additional data from CSV and Excel files. Using Power Query, the data was cleaned and transformed, followed by data modeling. The dashboard was then developed and published in Power BI Workspace with role-based access (Admin, Member, Contributor, Viewer).

3. Profitability by Product: Monitor the Gross Margin % for products to evaluate profitability and identify underperforming products that might require changes in marketing strategy.
   
### 4. Supply Chain View:
#### Objective:
1. Evaluate supply chain performance using critical metrics like Net Error, Absolute Error, Forecast Accuracy %, and sales quantities.
2. Monitor sales against forecasted quantities to ensure supply chain optimization.
#### Key Achievements:
1. Forecast Accuracy %: Measure the accuracy of sales forecasts and identify trends in underperformance to adjust future forecasting models.
2. Error Analysis: Track Net Error and Absolute Error to ensure forecasting models are aligned with actual sales performance, minimizing discrepancies.
3. Sales Quantity Comparison: Compare actual sales quantities to Forecasted Quantities to assess how well the supply chain is performing in terms of meeting demand.

### 5. Executive View:
#### Objective:

2. Market Share Comparison: Compare Market Share % with key competitors, identifying growth opportunities or areas where AtliQ can gain a stronger foothold.
3. Net Sales Benchmarking: Monitor Net Sales in comparison to AtliQ's competitors to evaluate the company's position in the market.

##  Key Insights
Based on the analysis, several key insights emerged:

#### 1. Operational Expenses and Losses:
AtliQ Hardware’s significant discounts combined with high operational costs are leading to losses. Reducing discounts and optimizing expenses could improve profitability.

#### 2. Amazon as the Key Revenue Driver: 
Amazon is the largest revenue contributor for AtliQ Hardware, with AQ Home Al 1 Generation 2 as the top-performing product. AtliQ Hardware should continue to nurture this relationship and focus on top-performing products.

#### 3. Underperformance in the USA: 
Products are underperforming in the USA, contributing to unprofitability. An in-depth analysis is needed to determine the causes and devise strategies to improve performance in this market.

#### 4. Market Share Growth: 
AtliQ Hardware’s market share increased significantly from 1.1% in 2021 to 5.9% in 2022, indicating positive growth in its market presence.

#### 5. Regional Performance:
1. Latin America: Poor performance with low revenue contribution and high operational expenses.
2. India: Strong sales and revenue contributions, though gross margin (GM%) and net profit could be improved.
   
## Recommendations
1. Optimize Discount Strategy: Review and optimize the discount strategy to minimize costs and enhance profitability.
2. Replicate Successful Campaigns: Expand successful marketing campaigns from Amazon and AQ Home Al 1 Generation 2 to other products.
3. Investigate Loss Areas: Focus on the USA market to understand the reasons for underperformance and address them with targeted strategies.
